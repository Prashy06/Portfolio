## 📌 About Me

I'm an Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) undergraduate with a passion for exploring technology at the intersection of logic and creativity. My interests span:

- Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning  
- Semiconductor Devices & Embedded Systems  
- Basics of Computer Science & Programming  


As an Electronics and Communication Engineering undergraduate, I’m passionate about exploring the intersection of modern technology and its real-world applications. My academic journey is rooted in the fundamentals of electronics, digital systems, and embedded technologies, while my curiosity drives me to delve into AI, emerging tech trends, and the basics of computer science.

Beyond the classroom, I’m deeply engaged in understanding global current affairs, geopolitics, and contemporary history believing that technology and policy evolve hand in hand. I'm also a sportsperson at heart, actively pursuing chess and badminton, where strategy, discipline, and agility shape my mindset. Whether it’s analyzing the future of gaming, exploring the latest devices, or discussing the impact of pop culture, music, and filmmaking I thrive at the crossroads of creativity and innovation.

I’m here to connect with thinkers, tinkerers, storytellers, engineers, and explorers anyone who believes that diverse interests aren’t distractions, but the building blocks of innovation.

## 💼 Projects

Here are a few highlights:

### LuminEye AI Pin
> LuminEye AI Pin is a compact, clip-on wearable designed to assist visually challenged individuals with real-time navigation, object recognition, and AI-driven voice assistance. 
By combining the functionalities of screen readers and AI assistants into a single device
LuminEye enhances accessibility and independence for the visually challenged.

Powered by cloud-based AI, it continuously learns user preferences, provides instant information, and acts as an alternative to traditional online search. Voice commands enable hands-free operation

### QuickRead - Article Summarizer
> For my CS50 final project, I created an AI Article Summarizer accepts a URL as input, fetches the article’s main content using web scraping, processes the extracted text using an AI model summarization via Hugging Face Transformers facebook bart-large-cnn and returns a short summary to the user. It’s built using the Flask web framework in Python, which manages routing, form input, and response rendering. For scraping, the app uses the newspaper3k library, a robust tool for parsing article content, removing boilerplate, and cleaning HTML noise

### Hyperspectral Imaging and Laser Profiling for Enhanced Intrusion Detection Systems IETE Review Paper
> This project demonstrates an AI-powered security system that combines Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) and Laser Profiling to accurately detect and classify intruders (human, animal and foliage) while minimizing false alarms. The system captures unique "spectral fingerprints" of materials (e.g., skin, fur) and pinpoints intrusion locations via laser beams this project reimagines perimeter security by teaching machines to perceive the world not just as shapes in motion, but as compositions of molecular signatures. Where conventional systems fail triggered by swaying branches or curious animals our solution introduces context-aware threat discrimination

### RFID Smart Shopping Cart
> Built an RFID-based Smart Shopping Cart that automates billing by scanning items as they're added to the cart. It updates totals in real-time, giving instant feedback via display, buzzer, and LEDs—no queues or manual checkout needed. Designed for scalability and real-world use, this project enhances retail efficiency and customer experience, making it ideal for modern supermarkets and automated stores.

### Eco-Friendly Peltier-Based Mini Refrigerator
> A solid-state mini refrigerator using Peltier modules, heatsinks, and cooling fans — all encased in an insulated 3D-modeled chamber. It’s simple, portable, and most importantly, eco-friendly.A compact, sustainable refrigerator powered by thermoelectric Peltier modules, eliminating the need for harmful refrigerants like CFCs or HFCs. The core of our design lies in the thermoelectric effect: when a voltage is applied to the Peltier module, one side gets cold while the other side gets hot.The cold side cools the inner chamber.The hot side is connected to heatsinks + fans to dissipate heat efficiently.
No gas, no compressors — just clean, solid-state physics.
